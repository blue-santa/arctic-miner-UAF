# UAF/NASA Arctic Miner Competition

This repository contains my notes, journal, sketches, and other random data associated with my involvement with UAF and Dr. Lawlor's participation in the NASA "Break the Ice" challenge.

Other students may find some of this content useful, as I will attempt to record my learning in a format that assists others in becoming a part of the UAF Robotic team.

## Getting Involved

Many students express interest in getting involved with this UAF project. 

### Incentives

There is a general excitement about the concept of being involved in robotics. A challenging and meaningful career may await a diligent student, as well as a chance to learn new skills and explore new possibilities. 

NASA is actively monitoring the progress of UAF's project, and students have their work displayed with this prominent employer. 

Past students have found employment with agencies such as SpaceX.

Another interesting fact is that the state of Alaska itself is growing in potential for commercial space exploration and development. There is a budding space program at the base of the Kenai pennisula. The Break The Ice challenge has opportunities to connect students with career openings that span the gas and mining industry on both a terrestrial and extra-terrestrial level. 

### Current Challenges

Many students are excited about the idea of getting involved with Break The Ice, but are not sure how to proceed.

This README.md document contains a journal of my own progress, starting from the beginning and moving through to the completion of the 2023 challenge involvement. 

## Becoming Familiar with the General Concept

#### Conversations with Dr. Lawlor as a First Step

I met with Dr. Lawlor in his office in February 2023 to discuss potential involvement.

He is most available for open discussion during his office hours, which are MWF 1300 to 1500 hrs. 

We also meet with other students as a part of the Robotics Club on Thursdays from 1300 to 1400 hrs in ELIF 118.

#### A Quick Overview

In the NASA Break The Ice robot challenge, the UAF team competes with other teams from around the world to build a robot that is capable of mining on extra terrestrial surfaces. 

At this time, UAF has progressed through various stages of the competition to become one of the final dozen or so teams to still be competing. In the previous round, NASA awarded UAF and the other successful competitors a modest five-figure financial investment to continue pursuing our research. 

At this time, Feb 2023, UAF is preparing a new iteration of our robotic mining robot to compete in the next round of the NASA competition.
