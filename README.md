# UAF/NASA Arctic Miner Competition

### About the Break The Ice Challenge

NASA is conducting an open challenge that allows participants to design and submit robotic lunar mining equipment.

The intent is to develop robotic, automated solutions to mine water (and other resources) on the lunar surface. The water can then be converted into other substances, such as fuel, which will open the possibility for additional space exploration at a greatly reduced cost.

### About UAF's Involvement

Dr. Lawlor and UAF have been involved with this project, and other similar endeavors, in previous years. The experience gained has allowed UAF to have a competitive position in the challenge.

In 2022, [UAF was chosen from the field of Phase 1 applicants](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/nasa-announces-newest-winners-in-break-the-ice-lunar-challenge.html) to successfully move to Phase 2. As a reward for UAF's current progress, NASA awarded UAF $23,000 to assist in further funding.

UAF is now working on a fully realized version of our submission for Phase 2 of the challenge.

### Meet Our Competitors

Our student team, led by Dr. Lawlor, is not alone in the race to complete Phase 2 with a working model. Here are the list of teams against whom we are competing:

* Aurora Robotics, Fairbanks, Alaska
* Cislune Excavators, Alhambra, California
* Ice Busters, Olathe, Kansas
* Lunar Wombats, Seattle, Washington
* Michigan Technological Universityâ€™s Planetary Surface Technology Development Lab, Houghton, Michigan
* Moog Inc., Elma, New York
* Moon Industry Inc., Netherlands
* OffWorld Robotic Mining Team, Aldie, Virginia
* Redwire Space, Jacksonville, Florida
* Space Trajectory, Brookings, South Dakota
* Starpath, San Francisco, California
* Team xTrac Planetoid Mines, Albuquerque, New Mexico
* Team Chandra, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India
* Terra Engineering, Gardena, California
* The Ice Diggers, Golden, Colorado

### About This Repository

This repository contains my notes, journal, sketches, and other random data associated with my involvement with UAF and Dr. Lawlor's participation in the NASA "Break the Ice" challenge.

Other students may find some of this content useful, as I will attempt to record my learning in a format that assists others in becoming a part of the UAF Robotic team.

## Getting Involved

### Incentives

There is a general excitement among students about the concept of being involved in robotics. A challenging and meaningful career may await a diligent student, as well as a chance to learn new skills and explore new possibilities. 

NASA is actively monitoring the progress of UAF's project, and students have their work displayed with this prominent employer. Note that NASA is planning the Artemis mission to the Shackleton Crater at the Lunar South Pole. These missions have an objective to harvest water from lunar ice, which can then be converted to rocket fuel. 

Past students have found employment with agencies such as SpaceX.

Another interesting fact is that the state of Alaska itself is growing in potential for commercial space exploration and development. There is a budding space program at the base of the Kenai pennisula. The Break The Ice challenge has opportunities to connect students with career openings that span the gas and mining industry on both a terrestrial and extra-terrestrial level. 

### Current Obstacles

Many students are excited about the idea of getting involved with Break The Ice, but are not sure how to proceed.

This README.md document contains a journal of my own progress, starting from the beginning and moving through to the completion of the 2023 challenge involvement. 

### Timeline

The current iteration of UAF's robotic miner needs to be operation by sometime in June 2023. This will give ample time for finalization of the product before all content, robotic products, and demonstrations can be handed over to NASA in Fall 2023. 

## Becoming Familiar with the General Concept

#### Conversations with Dr. Lawlor as a First Step

I met with Dr. Lawlor in his office in February 2023 to discuss potential involvement.

He is most available for open discussion during his office hours, which are MWF 1300 to 1500 hrs. 

We also meet with other students as a part of the Robotics Club on Thursdays from 1300 to 1400 hrs in ELIF 118.

#### A Quick Overview

In the NASA Break The Ice robot challenge, the UAF team competes with other teams from around the world to build a robot that is capable of mining on extra terrestrial surfaces. 

At this time, UAF has progressed through various stages of the competition to become one of the final dozen or so teams to still be competing. In the previous round, NASA awarded UAF and the other successful competitors a modest five-figure financial investment to continue pursuing our research. 

At this time, Feb 2023, UAF is preparing a new iteration of our robotic mining robot to compete in the next round of the NASA competition.
