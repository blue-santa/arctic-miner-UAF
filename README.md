# UAF/NASA Arctic Miner Competition

### About the Break The Ice Challenge

NASA is conducting an open challenge that allows participants to design and submit robotic lunar mining equipment.

The intent is to develop robotic, automated solutions to mine water (and other resources) on the lunar surface. The water can then be converted into other substances, such as fuel, which will open the possibility for additional space exploration at a greatly reduced cost.

Be sure to watch the video on the homepage and to read the official rules.

The challenge has three phases, and each phase has various levels within the phase. 

Currently, the competition has reached Phase 2: Level 2. 

In this stage, competitors build an actual prototype of the ideas that they have submitted to NASA previously. Competitors then run the prototype as a demonstration for 15 days, and submit the results towards the latter half of 2023. 

### UAF's Involvement

Dr. Lawlor and UAF have been involved with this project, and other similar endeavors, for approximately a decade. 

The experience gained and the hard work of many students before us have allowed UAF to have a competitive position in the challenge.

In 2022, UAF's submission for Phase 2: Level 1 was successful. [NASA chose UAF from the field of applicants](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/nasa-announces-newest-winners-in-break-the-ice-lunar-challenge.html) to successfully move to Phase 2: Level 2. 

As a reward for UAF's current progress, NASA awarded UAF $25,000 to assist in further funding. Some of these funds are making continued development possible for the UAF Robotics team as we move to Phase 2: Level 2.

### Meet Our Competitors

Our student team, led by Dr. Lawlor, is not alone in the race to complete Phase 2 with a working model. Here are the list of teams against whom we are competing:

### About This Repository

This repository contains my notes, journal, sketches, and other random data associated with my involvement with this challenge.

Other students may find some of this content useful, therefore I am attempting to record my learning in a format that assists others in becoming a part of the UAF Robotics team.

## Getting Involved

### Incentives

There is a general excitement among students about the concept of being involved in robotics, even before learning about UAF's Break The Ice opportunity. 

Many students see computer science and robotics as an opportunity for a rewarding career.

#### NASA's Mining Initiative

NASA is actively monitoring the progress of UAF's project, and students have their work displayed with this prominent employer. 

Interested students may find it useful to know that NASA is planning a series of missions, dubbed the "Artemis missions", for which this Break The Ice challenge is providing relevant research and discovery. 

In the Artemis missions, NASA intends to send manned lunar mining equipment to the Shackleton Crater at the Lunar South Pole. 

The objective is to harvest water from lunar ice, and the water can then be converted to rocket fuel. 

Past students have found employment with agencies such as SpaceX and other prominent space agencies.

#### Alaska is Home to a Growing Space Race Initiative

Another interesting fact is that the state of Alaska itself is growing in potential for commercial space exploration and development. 

There is a budding space program, [Alaska Aerospace](https://akaerospace.com/), at the base of the Kenai pennisula. 

Fairbank's own military base, Eielson Air Force Base, has partitioned one of its installations near Fairbanks to serve as an installation for the new Space Force.

Alaska is renowned for its connection to the oil and gas industries. Launching satelites and other payloads from Alaska may have advantages over other locations due to its proximity to these natural resources.

The Break The Ice challenge has opportunities to connect students with career openings that span the gas and mining industry on both a terrestrial and extra-terrestrial level.

### Current Obstacles

Many students are excited about the idea of getting involved with Break The Ice, but are not sure how to proceed.

This README.md document contains a journal of my own progress, starting from the beginning and moving through to the completion of the 2023 challenge involvement. 

### Timeline

The current iteration of UAF's robotic miner needs to be operation by sometime in June 2023. This will give ample time for finalization of the product before all content, robotic products, and demonstrations can be handed over to NASA in Fall 2023. 

## Becoming Familiar with the General Concept

#### Conversations with Dr. Lawlor as a First Step

Dr. Lawlor is most available for open discussion during his office hours, which are MWF 1300 to 1500 hrs. 

We also meet with other students as a part of the Robotics Club on Thursdays from 1300 to 1400 hrs in ELIF 118.

Dr. Lawlor and other students are also available for chat discussion on the Aurora Robotics Lab Discord server (this server is separate from the main CS UAF Discord server):

#### A Quick Overview

In the NASA Break The Ice robot challenge, the UAF team competes with other teams from around the world to build a robot that is capable of mining on extra terrestrial surfaces. 

At this time, UAF has progressed through various stages of the competition to become one of the final dozen or so teams to still be competing. In the previous round, NASA awarded UAF and the other successful competitors a modest five-figure financial investment to continue pursuing our research. 

At this time, Feb 2023, UAF is preparing a new iteration of our robotic mining robot to compete in the next round of the NASA competition.
